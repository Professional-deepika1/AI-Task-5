# Task 5 â€” Decision Trees and Random Forests

##  Objective
Learn and compare tree-based models for classification using the Heart Disease dataset.

##  Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

##  Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.  
2. Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** and visualized the tree.  
3. Controlled overfitting by adjusting `max_depth`.  
4. Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** and compared results.  
5. Evaluated using:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Cross-Validation
6. Interpreted **Feature Importances**.

##  Results
- Decision Tree Accuracy: ~85%  
- Random Forest Accuracy: ~90%  
- Cross-Validation Mean Accuracy: ~89%
